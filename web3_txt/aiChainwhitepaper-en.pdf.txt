AICHAINExecutive Summary
Our vision for AICHAIN is to create a platform that can facilitate 
the communication, cooperation and data sharing among partic -
ipants by enabling data transaction, protecting data security and 
disrupting data concentration, therefore improving the efficiency 
and productivity of the AI industry and allowing everybody, not just 
the tech giants, to gain the most out of the digitalization era. The AICHAIN is a public chain that is specially designed as a 
blockchain infrastructure for AI applications. The AICHAIN 
inherited the advantages of blockchain technology, such as decen -
tralization, open source, tamper-proof and anonymous, to solve 
the current challenges of AI such as data domination.  However, 
different from other blockchains that are strictly constrained by 
data size and programming languages, the AICHAIN used technol -
ogies such as plug-in visual machine, out-of-chain storage and API 
etc. to allow larger data set and different programming languages. 
Moreover, as the ability to attract applications, users and developers 
remind the key challenge for all competing AI blockchain platforms, 
AICHAIN has gained a strong competitive advantage by having 
reached strategic partnerships with multiple AI applications 
teams to kick start the ecosystem among data supplier, application 
developers, platform resource providers and consumers. 3

AICHAIN The background of AICHAIN
1�1 The raising of Blockchain technology
The blockchain technology contains the following advantages:
Decentralized
Open SourceBlockchain is one of the mostly discussed 
technology nowadays as a potential 
successor of the internet. The technology 
combines a set of existing technology, 
including distributed data storage, peer-to-
peer transmission, consensus mechanism 
and encryption algorithm, to introduce of 
a new way of data formation, transmis -
sion, storage and usage. The breakthroughs 
brought by blockchain technology has the 
potential to fundamentally change the 
existing economic and financial mode of 
operation and may even lead to a new tech -nological innovation and industrial change 
on a global scale.
A blockchain is a tamper-proof and decen -
tralized data structure that joins data 
blocks chronologically. The nature of the 
blockchain is a distributed ledger system. 
Encrypted digital assets, such as Bitcoin, is 
the digital currency of this system. In other 
words, blockchain serves as the underlying 
technology for digital assets and for a 
distributed, encrypted and credible 
accounting and clearing system.
Decentralization is the fundamental characteristic of the blockchain. In a traditional 
centralized network system, the destruction of a central node can paralyze the entire 
system. However, for the blockchain network, due to the use of distributed ledger 
and storage, there is no centralized hardware or institution, so rights and obligations 
of any node are equal.  Therefore, data blocks in the system will be maintained and 
protected by all the notes in the system, and attacking a node cannot destroy the 
entire network.
Blockchain adapts an open source system, which promotes communication, partici -
pation, and development.  Except for the private information of transaction parties, 
blockchain publics all its data and codes, so that anyone can query blockchain data AICHAIN 
Whitepaper2
AICHAINTamper-proof
AnonymousOnce a piece of information has been verified and added to the blockchain, 
the information on the chain is backed up in each of the nodes in the network 
permanently. As a result, to temper the information, the only way is to attack 
the entire system, requiring a computation power that is stronger than all the 
computation power in the earth combined. Therefore, the data in the network is 
nearly impossible to tamper.
In the blockchain system, although all data logging and operation updates are made 
public to the whole network node, the private information of the trader is handled 
by hash encryption, which allows anonymous data exchange and the transaction. 
Encryption is simply a method of conversion that converts the original information 
through an algorithm. The recipient of the information can decrypt by the secret 
key to get the original information. The blockchain uses many mature encryption 
algorithms to ensure the system is reliability and security.
Block chain technology, after the steam 
engine, power, information and Internet 
technology, has the highest potential to be 
the core technology that triggers the fifth 
round of subversive revolutionary wave. 
Just as the steam engine frees people’s 
productivity, electricity has solved the most 
basic needs of people, and information technology and the Internet have revo -
lutionized traditional industries, such 
as retailors, music and publications, the 
block chain technology has a potential to 
achieve decentralized digital asset transfer 
and to promote the transformation of 
“information Internet” to “value Internet”.and the development of related applications, the entire system information is highly 
transparent.AICHAIN 
Whitepaper3
AICHAIN1�2 The development and the current status of AI
Artificial intelligence (AI) enables 
automation of some tasks that have long 
required human labor. These transforma -
tions will open up new opportunities for 
individuals, the economy, and society and 
unleash the next wave of digital disruption.
The enormous potential benefits of AI 
have already been widely accepted, and 
the industry has been on an acceleration. 
According to Mckinsey report:
(1) AI can bring tangible benefits to 
serious adopters
Serious adopters are able to obtain real 
value through AI that early adopters that 
combine strong digital capability with 
proactive strategies have higher profit 
margins and expect the performance gap 
with other firms to widen in the future in 
the areas at least of retail, electric utilities, 
manufacturing, health care, and education. 
According to Accenture, by 2035, companies 
that can successfully implement AI will 
increase their profit by 38% on average. 
Besides, AI will bring 14 trillion GVA 
(Gross Value Added) to 12 countries and 16 
industries.(2) Investment is growing fast
The same Mckinsey report also reveals 
that the investment in AI is growing at a 
high rate. In 2016, companies have invested 
$26B to $39B USD in artificial intelligence 
globally, a number that accounts for 3 times 
external investment growth since 2013. 
90 percent of this spent on R&D andde -
ployment, and 10 percent on AI acquisi -
tions. VC and PE financing, grants, and 
seed investments also grew rapidly, albeit 
from a small base, to a combined total of 
$6 billion to $9 billion. 
(3) Countries have been competing on AI
US, China, Japan and European countries 
all have provided favorable regulations 
and funding support to encourage AI 
development. December 2017, the Ministry 
of Industry and Information Technology 
(MIIT) of China announced the “Encourage 
the New Generation of AI development 
Three Year Plan(2018-2020)”, aiming to gain 
the global competition in the AI technology 
by the year of 2020.
With world-wide enthusiasm and several technological breaks though, the future 
of AI industry seems to be brighter and more tangible than over. AICHAIN 
Whitepaper4
AICHAINHowever, several challenges still remind until we can see its full potential:
a. Data is concentrated at the hands of a 
few large players
AI loves data. The more data, the better the 
models. However, under the current model, 
data is mainly collected and dominated 
by large players so that it is difficult for 
a startup team to lunch an AI project as 
they do not obtain sufficient data for model 
training. 
b. The ownership of data is unclear
As sensors are embedded in all sorts of 
everyday objects, from connected cars to 
devices across the IoT, consumer data will be generated exponentially by these devices 
and stored in centralized databases. 
However, users who helped generate the 
data cannot benefit from the process.
c. The quality and “trainability” of big 
data is in question
Big data has great potential to enhance 
artificial intelligence AI models by 
providing richer and more comprehensive 
data set. However, big data itself is facing a 
challenge of 3Vs, namely, Variety, Velocity 
and Volume, leading to a noisy, messy, 
unstructured and difficult-to-interpret data 
set.AICHAIN 
Whitepaper5
AICHAIN1�3 How blockchain can improve AI
The characteristics of blockchain can 
overcome the challenges of AI and 
transform AI by:
(1)  Decentralized/shared control 
encourages data sharing
In a public blockchain, data can be shared 
among different ecosystems in a plan -
et-scale ecosystem. All participants of 
the AI industry: consumers, developers, 
resource providers and data suppliers can 
freely exchange resources and value on a 
global scale and improve global efficiency. 
For instance, spikes in energy usage in 
some factories in China might be correlated 
with fraudulent auto parts emerging on 
the market a day’s worth of shipping 
later. Overall, blockchain will facilitate 
the process of aggregating, sanitizing, 
repackaging and circulating of data. 
(2) Improve data quality
Leads to provenance on training/testing 
data & models, to improve the trustworthi -
ness of the data & models. This application 
addresses the fact that if you train on 
garbage data, then you’ll get a garbage 
model. Same thing for testing data. Garbage 
in, garbage out.
The blockchain improves the credibility 
of the data set by the implementation of game theory and its technical structure. 
Moreover, as blockchain allows data to be 
exchanged for value easily, it incentivizes 
data providers to provide clean and easy to 
use data. 
(3) Native assets/exchanges
Leads to training/testing data & models 
as intellectual property (IP) assets, which 
leads to decentralized data & model 
exchanges. It also gives better control for 
upstream usage of data.
Claiming copyright of and licensing data 
& models was possible before blockchain 
technology. The laws have served this for a 
while. But blockchain technology makes it 
better, because:
• If someone has created a data or 
model, such record will be permanently 
recorded in the blockchain. The creator can 
claim the copyright, regardless of if having 
the intention to commercialize it. 
• With the copy right, the creator can 
license usage rights to others. For example, 
you can license your data to someone else 
to build their own model.
• A tamper-resistant global public 
registry helps the creator to protect the 
copy right if any disrupt occurs.AICHAIN 
Whitepaper6
AICHAIN1�4 The challenges of merging AI with blockchain
1�5 How AICHAIN is going to solve the challenges(1)  Size and programming language 
constrains hinder AI applications
Currently, all blockchains targeted on 
AI applications are all based on the 
Ethereum, whose capability is limited 
by the size and programing language of 
its virtual machine. A simple application 
such as CryptoKitties has caused the 
Ethereum blockchain crashed and slowed 
down. Therefore, although the Ethereum 
blockchain might be good for writing smart 
contracts and record transactions history, 
for complicated applications such as AI, 
blockchain has to upgrade its design to 
support larger data set and more advanced 
programming languages.(2) Few AI application has been running 
on current blockchains
As one key benefit of blockchain is data 
sharing, without sufficient AI applica -
tions on the blockchain to share their data, 
the value of blockchain cannot be fully 
utilized. For AI developers, it’s in their best 
interest to wait and see which blockchain 
attracts real AI applications before they 
devote their time and energy to develop 
an application on the blockchain. As a 
result, we can see the momentum effect 
in this market is significant and starting 
a momentum by attracting the first group 
of developers is considered to be most 
difficult. The current AI blockchains, 
however, still do not have initial adopters. 
(1) Plug-in virtual machine
The way for AICHAIN to overcome the 
language constrain is to use the plug-in 
virtual machine, an integrated open-source 
docker container. By relying on conventions 
and publishing a uniform standard of 
docker IMG image files, the application 
environment of the AICHAIN can be unified 
and upgraded independently. Moreover, 
docker IMG image files are able to integrate 
multiple programming languages, 
including sophisticated AI applications such as tenserflow, to make it possible to 
trigger the running of AI applications on 
AICHAIN nodes.
(2) Out-of-chain data storage
AICHAIN will store executable files 
data and resources data outside of the 
blockchain and only include the description 
and tag of such data on the chain, therefore 
to ensure sophisticated application and 
large data set can be run on the AICHAIN 
platform. AICHAIN 
Whitepaper7
AICHAIN(3) Easy adoption
AICHAIN provides API dedicated to deploy, 
extract, and enquire application data 
resources, therefore allowing developers 
to easily connect their AI applications to 
the AICHAIN platform to complete user 
identity verification, payment verifica -
tion and so on, without the requirement of 
understanding the underlying blockchain 
technology. (4) Ready-to-use applications
The AICHAIN team has rich experience in 
AI technologies and are running multiple 
successful AI applications. Unlike other 
AI blockchain platforms that depend on 
external AI applications, applications run 
by the AICHAIN team will be the first group 
of applications to be run of the chain to 
kick start the momentum and attract more 
applications into the platform. AICHAIN 
Whitepaper8
AICHAIN The AICHAIN platform
2�1 Overview of AICHAIN
The AICHAIN will focus on the development 
of artificial intelligence, the purpose is to 
make artificial intelligence more effective 
and secure to benefit everyone’s life. In 
the future where AI supplies new produc -
tivity, blockchain will be used to maintain 
production relationship. The purpose 
of AICHAIN is to build a platform with blockchain as an underlying ledger. Under 
the protection of data ownership, data 
owners are encouraged to share data, and 
therefore application developers will have 
more data to create more valuable appli -
cations to meet the needs of all partici -
pants and the market, making the entire 
ecosystem richer and more robust.
1  Create a benign ecosystem and 
encourage more people to participate in 
the development and implementation of AI 
applications;
2  Promote the development of artificial intelligence in a credible and reliable 
environment;
3  Turn privately generated data into 
more refined services for everyone.
Ultimately, we hope the AICHAIN platform 
will transform the AI industry by 
redirecting the power from monopolistic 
companies to autonomous communities, 
so as to attract more people to participate in the development of artificial intelli -
gence and truly realize the sound ecological 
development of co-construction and 
sharing.The purpose of AICHAIN is to:AICHAIN

An ordinary user who has a bunch of cats and dogs pictures, hoping to 
have a tool to help him store the pictures by category. This paper will explain how the AICHAIN works through a classic “cat or dog” graphic 
identification example. For a complete understanding of the AICHAIN, you might refer to 
our technical yellow paper.2�2 The technical of AICHAIN
Suppose there are 4 main bodies (companies or individuals):
A
B
C
D
Scenario 1: Developers need data to complete machine learning 
in order to develop AI applications
A: is the data provider, who 
owns pictures of cats and dogs, 
as well as the marking results 
(cats or dogs) for each picture.
B: is the consumer of data, a 
company that develops an AI 
application that can identify 
cats and dogs pictures.
AICHAIN 
Whitepaper10
AICHAINScenario 2: Users use their own computer to run “Cat or Dog” AI 
application
Scenario 3: Users use their computer resources provided by resource 
providers on the platform to run “Cat or Dog” AI applicationB: is an AI application provider 
that develops the “Cat or Dog” 
identification AI application. 
The application provider then 
deploys the information of the 
application to the AICHAIN for 
users to download the “Cat or Dog” 
application executable file data
D: ordinary users who have their 
own graphics card computer that 
can support the operation of cats 
and dogs to identify AI application.
Step 1: B release the information of “Cat or Dog” 
application to the blockchain and provide AI 
application executable file data for users to 
download.
Step 2: User D does not have a suitable 
computer to run the “Cat of Dog” application, so 
he/she need to borrow C’s platform resources, 
which can be obtained by transferring AITs to 
the ADU address of the resource provided by C.  
Step 3: C then release a graphics AI server 
resource to D.
Step 4: D then pays AITs to B to obtain the ADU 
address of “Cat or Dog” application from B.
Step 5: D download and run the “Cat or Dog” 
on the computer resource rented from the 
platform. Then D can upload the picture and 
finish the classification.

AICHAINOther Details
1 Data providers, application providers, 
and platform resource providers all deploy 
their own resources to the blockchain by 
creating a single transaction.
2 Consumers need to transfer virtual 
currency to the address of the ADU unit of 
the above resources to apply for the right to 
use.
3 In the subsequent process, consumers 
need to provide the public key of their 
wallet using to pay for: the data provider, the application provider and the platform 
resource providers. Therefore, resource 
provider can have enough information 
to verify the user’s identity and whether 
there is enough virtual money to pay. (See 
Chapter 5 of AICHAIN Yellow Paper for 
details.)

Whitepaper12
AICHAINBy using blockchain technology to ensure the 
sovereignty of the data and provide a robust 
market place for all participants of the AI 
industry, the AICHAIN is able to incentivize 
more participants to join the AICHAIN 
community and gradually enrich the data layer resources and empower everyone to 
gain the most out of AI. 
In the AICHAIN ecosystem, there are four 
groups of participants:

For business (developers and data suppliers): a Resource Sharing Platform
AICHAIN as a public infrastructure, will 
not only connect but also promote resource 
sharing among the participants, in order 
to disrupt data concentration, protect data 
ownership, encourage specialization and improve productivity. Therefore AICHAIN 
is able to benefit everyone within the 
system and increase the total value on the 
platform.
To further improve the efficiency of data 
sharing on the platform, AICHAIN will 
launch AI search engine so that both 
suppliers and demanders can easily find a

AICHAINFor consumers, AICHAIN can be simply 
regarded as an AI Application Store where 
they can assemble different AI applications 
into their own and special AI application. 
Besides, with the training of application 
with consumers’ own personal data, such 
application will be truly retailor-make and 
unique. All the transactions will be done through AIT.
The AICHAIN aims to provide all possible 
AI applications that to cover the needs and 
provide convenience for one’s personal and 
professional life, such as AI consulting, AI 
analysis, and AI medication etc.For consumers: an AI Application Store
2�5  The AICHAIN Applications under Developing
The current recruitment process often 
requires the matching services provided by 
third-party platforms, and therefore, those 
platforms collected a significant amount of job seekers’ sensitive information. As 
a result, job-seekers are facing the risk of 
private information leakage, which leads to 
frustrating calls and email harassment and To attract more participates to the AICHAIN 
community and speed up the formation of 
AICHAIN Ecosystem, the AICHAIN has been developing several AI applications for the 
AICHAIN.
2�5�1 AI recruitmentAICHAIN 
Whitepaper15
AICHAINThe users will have their own smart 
assistant. The assistant will not only help 
users to schedule and find information, 
but also accompany their own chat, watch 
a movie, play video games, which is what 
many people expect.
With the development of many AI applica -
tions, in the future, everyone can use the AI 
application store to transfer the intelligent 
assistant module and input their own 
information and requirements. In this way, 
a dedicated virtual intelligent assistant will 
be generated, the whole process just like 
downloading the APP to the mobile phone.
In daily life, the assistant will chat with 
you at any time, watch the sports game 
with you, and share your joys and sorrows when watching the drama;
In various meetings, the assistant will not 
only help you to record the content of the 
meeting, to form the meeting summary, but 
also to help you to remember the identity 
and appearance of each participant;
In the live broadcast scene, the anchors’ 
intelligent assistant will assist in the active 
atmosphere and interact with the fans 
according to the instructions of the anchor; 
the user’s intelligent assistant may send 
gifts to the anchor and interact with the 
anchors’ assistants.
In the game scene, the image of the 
exclusive intelligent assistant will replace 
the traditional role of participation in the 2�5�2 AI assistantother security issues.
AI Recruitment, which will be found in the 
AICHAIN though AICHAIN search engine, 
can create a safe hiring and job seeking 
environment where:
1.  Companies can post job descriptions 
and requirement and  candidates can 
describe their own education background, 
learning ability and work experience, in a 
completely anonymous blockchain system,
2. Smart recruitment application will 
match both sides through algorithm, 
and will match both sides’ information 
feedback;3. If the company express the interest, the 
entrance of CV delivery will be opened;
4. At the same time, if the job seeker intends 
to apply, they will send the resume to the 
company.
Whether business user or individual 
users, they just need to select the relevant 
application in the AI store, to pay 
developers the AIT to use their own data 
resources to create a personalized smart 
recruitment process. This will signifi -
cantly improve hiring efficiency and 
avoid the risk that third-party platforms 
storing significant amounts of personal 
information.AICHAIN

AICHAIN2�5�3 VR-AI tutor
Online education always attracts a lot of 
attention because it offers a huge variety 
of contents and enables students to listen 
to the class provided by world class 
instructors while at a low financial and 
time cost.
However, the problem with current 
online education is that the contents are 
not interactive and engaging enough for 
students to stay interested.
The combination of AR and AI can solve 
this problem by providing: 
Rich online learning resources: bringing 
together all kinds of online education 
resources, teacher courses, without time 
and space constraints.Customized contents: learning plans and 
materials will be adopted automatically 
through interactions with the learner to 
achieve optimized learning outcomes.
Engaging delivery method: VR simulates an 
in-class and other more engaging learning 
environment so that learners do not need to 
stare the screen for a long time, creating a 
fun learning experience.
Right now, VR-AR tutor focus on children 
education. In the future, VR-AR tutor will 
be extended to more subdivided areas such 
as learning foreign languages, musical 
instruments, dance, calligraphy and 
painting as well as counseling models for 
adults so that you can learn without leaving 
home.game. Players will feel more kind in person, 
and the assistant can even continue the 
game when you must temporarily leave.
In the future, the virtual assistant will be 
more personalized by identifying your appearance, your voice, and recording 
all your habits and preferences. As the 
interaction scenario increases and deepens, 
the accumulated personal data will help 
the assistant better domesticated, and have 
unique charisma.AICHAIN

AICHAIN3�2 Future iterative planning of AICHAIN
Iteration of the underlying architecture
Business application iterationWhen the AICHAIN code itself loopholes, usually take a system upgrade. A loophole 
needs to be analyzed, tested and audited by a code committee and submitted to the deci -
sion-making committee for filing. When the following major loopholes (not limited to) to 
take a system upgrade:
• Affect user funds
• Major safety issues
• Affect system security
When minor vulnerabilities occur, the code board is patched directly.
The AICHAIN will be a completely open source project. The AICHAIN system hopes 
to link the block chain with the reality through technical innovation and conceptual 
innovation. Therefore, in commercial applications, the AICHAIN Foundation will select 
the appropriate third-party cooperation, industry and application iteration.AICHAIN

AICHAIN AICHAIN Foundation
5�1 Establishment of the foundation
5�2 Governance principleThe AICHAIN Foundation (or called 
“Foundation” in the following paper) is 
a non-profit organization established in 
Singapore. The Foundation will act as 
AICHAIN’s sponsor entity, who committed 
to support AICHAIN’s development, 
construction and governance, trans -
parency, advocacy, and promotion 
work, as well as promoting the safety 
and harmonious development of the 
community.The AICHAIN team commissioned a 
trusted third party organization to 
assist the team in setting up foundation 
entities in Singapore and to maintain the 
day-to-day operations as well as reporting 
the entity architecture. After establishing 
the Foundation, it selects the appropriate 
members of the community to join the 
functional Committee of the Foundation to 
participate in the actual management and 
decision-making.
The design objective of the AICHAIN 
Foundation governance structure mainly 
focused on the sustainability of AICHAIN 
platform, the effectiveness of the strategy formulation, the management effective -
ness, the risk control and the efficient 
operation of the platform economy.
Although there are arguments advocating 
that Blockchain is a de-centralized or 
distributed self-governance community 
system. We believe that the absolute de-cen -
tralized may bring the absolute “fairness” 
but more likely to be further “inefficient”. 
Therefore, the core idea of the Foundation is to absorb the concept of in the management 
structure of central governance, including 
the highest decision-making authority 
strategic Committee and major issues of 
the centralized procedure to improve the 
efficiency of the whole operation of the 
community.5�2�1 The combination of centralized governance and distributed 
architectureAICHAIN 
Whitepaper23
AICHAINThe function of Committee and functional 
units coexist in the Foundation for daily 
affairs, which will set up permanent 
functional units, such as R&D department, 
marketing department, operation 
department, financial and human 
resources departments to handle daily 
affairs.
At the same time, a functional Committee is 
set up to make decisions on the important 
functions of the Foundation. Unlike the 
functional units, functional Committees exist in a virtual architecture where 
members of the Committee can be from 
any place of the world and do not have to 
work full-time. However, it must meet the 
requirements of the Committee’s expert 
qualifications and be able to undertake 
to present and make comments when 
the Committee is required to present. 
The functional Committee will also set 
up a regular meeting system to ensure 
the effective promotion of major deci -
sion-making matters.5�2�2 The function of Committee and functional units coexist
The risk management will be the most 
important element in the process of 
studying the strategic development of 
AICHAIN. As a computer technology 
with great on-going revolutionary, the 
development of Blockchain is still in its 
infancy, so it is very important to grasp 
its development trend. The principle of risk management, when making sure the 
Foundation makes important decisions, 
takes full account of the risk factors, the 
possibility and influence of its occurrence, 
and makes corresponding countermea -
sures through decision-making. Thus, the 
development and iteration of the AICHAIN 
is on the right path.
From the creation of the AICHAIN, it always 
adhere to the close integration with the 
business as its purpose. The Foundation 
also follows this objective. Even if the 
Foundation will present as a non-profit 
organization, but the Foundation wants 
to get the maximum possible recognition 
of the business world. To get the business 
application of revenue, feedback to the Foundation and the community, while 
further promoting the Foundation as 
well as the development and upgrade of 
AICHAIN. The Foundation also takes full 
account of this principle in the selection 
of talent and its architecture. It focuses on 
attracting experts with technical expertise, 
including industry experts who have a 
deep understanding of business.5�2�3 Risk oriented governance principles

AICHAINReferring to the governance experience 
of the traditional commercial world, 
AICHAIN Foundation also intends to set 
up special monitoring and reporting 
channels (Whistle-Blower). Designated 
by the strategic decision Committee as a 
window and we welcome the community 
participants to join in the management, 
supervision and the operation of Whistle-
Blower channel. Those include, but are not 
limited to, new breakthroughs or recom -
mendations that have significant implica -
tions for the Foundation or the Blockchain 
technologies, community operations issues, 
crisis information and fraud reporting or fraud, etc.
The Foundation will publish a unified 
information collection window, while 
ensuring the privacy of the information 
collected. At the same time, the Foundation 
publish periodic reports and irregular 
news releases in the form of community 
participation in all parties to disclose the 
Foundation operation and development of 
AICHAIN. Meanwhile, the main contacts 
of the Foundation management will be 
fully open, and accept the supervision and

The AICHAIN Foundation believes that 
there are numerous risks involved in the 
development, maintenance and running of 
AICHAIN, many of which are beyond the 
control of the AICHAIN Foundation. Each 
AICHAIN Token purchaser should peruse, 
comprehend and consider carefully the 
risks described below in addition to the 
other information stated herein before 
deciding to participate in the AICHAIN 
Token crowdsale campaign. 
Each AICHAIN Token purchaser should pay 
particular attention to the fact that, while 
the AICHAIN Foundation is established in 
the Republic of Singapore, AICHAIN and AICHAIN Token lie in cyberspace only 
without physical presence and hence do 
not fall within or pertain to any specific 
jurisdiction. 
Participating in the AICHAIN Token 
crowdsale campaign shall be an action 
based upon prudent decision and will be 
deemed as the relevant AICHAIN Token 
purchaser having been fully aware of and 
agreed to take all the risks below.

Each AICHAIN Token purchaser should pay 
particular attention to the fact that, while 
the AICHAIN Foundation is established in 
the Republic of Singapore, AICHAIN and 
AICHAIN Token lie in cyberspace only

Participating in the AICHAIN Token 
crowdsale campaign shall be an action 
based upon prudent decision and will be 
deemed as the relevant AICHAIN Token 
purchaser having been fully aware of and 
agreed to take all the risks below.
1) Termination of the Campaign 
The AICHAIN Token crowdsale campaign 
may be early terminated, in case of which a 
purchaser may only be refunded with part 
of his/her payment as a result of the Bitcoin 
/ Ether price volatility and/or the expenses 
incurred by the AICHAIN Foundation. 
2) Insufficient Information Availability 
AICHAIN is at the stage of development 
as of the date of this Whitepaper and 
its philosophy, consensus mechanism, 
algorithm, code and other technical speci -
fications and parameters could be updated 
and changed frequently and constantly. While this Whitepaper has contained 
the then up-to-date key information of 
AICHAIN, it is not absolutely complete and 
is subject to adjustments and updates that 
the AICHAIN Foundation might make from 
time to time for certain purposes. The 
AICHAIN Foundation is not in a position, 
nor obliged, to keep the purchasers 
closely posted on every detail of AICHAIN 
development (including its progress and 
expected milestones no matter whether 
rescheduled or not) and therefore will not 
necessarily provide the purchasers with 
timely and full access to all the information 
relating to AICHAIN that may emerge 
from time to time. The insufficiency of 
information disclosure is inevitable and 
reasonable. 
3) Regulatory Measures 
Crypto-tokens are being, or may be, 
overseen by the regulatory authorities 
of various jurisdictions. The AICHAIN 
Foundation may receive queries, notices, 
warnings, requests or rulings from one or 
more regulatory authorities from time to 
time, or may even be ordered to suspend or 
discontinue any action in connection with 
the Campaign, AICHAIN’s development 
or AICHAIN Token. The development, 
marketing, promotion or otherwise of 
AICHAIN or the AICHAIN Token crowdsale 
campaign may be seriously affected, 
hindered or terminated as a result. And 
since regulatory policies could change 
from time to time, existing regulatory 
permission or tolerance on AICHAIN or the 
AICHAIN Token crowdsale campaign in 
any jurisdiction could be just temporary. 
AICHAIN Token could be defined from AICHAIN 
Whitepaper50
AICHAINtime to time as a virtual commodity, digital 
asset or even securities or currency in 
various jurisdictions and therefore could 
be prohibited from being traded or held 
in certain jurisdictions pursuant to local 
regulatory requirements. 
 4) Cryptography 
Cryptography is evolving and cannot 
guarantee absolute security at all times. 
Advances in cryptography, such as code 
cracking, or technical advances such as the 
development of quantum computers, could 
present risks to all cryptography-based 
systems including AICHAIN. This could 
result in the theft, loss, disappearance, 
destruction or devaluation of the AICHAIN 
Token held by any person. To a reasonable 
extent, the AICHAIN Foundation will be 
prepared to take proactive or remedial 
steps to update the protocol underlying 
AICHAIN in response to any advances in 
cryptography and to incorporate additional 
reasonable security measures where 
appropriate The future of cryptography or 
security innovations is unpredictable while 
the AICHAIN Foundation will try its best 
to accommodate the continuing changes in 
the domains of cryptography and security. 
5) Development Failure or Abortion 
AICHAIN is still in the process of 
development, rather than a finished 
product ready to launch. Due to the techno -
logical complexity of the AICHAIN system, 
the AICHAIN Foundation could be faced 
with unforeseeable and/or insurmountable 
difficulties from time to time. Accordingly, the development of AICHAIN could fail or 
abort at any time for any cause (including 
insufficiency of funds). The development 
failure or abortion would result in 
non-availability of the purchased AICHAIN 
Token for Crowdsale to any purchaser. 
6) Theft of Crowdsale Proceeds 
There may be attempts to steal the 
crowdsale proceeds received by the 
AICHAIN Foundation (including the fiat 
currency amount converted therefrom). 
Such a theft or attempted theft may affect 
the ability of the AICHAIN Foundation 
to fund the development of AICHAIN. 
While the AICHAIN Foundation will adopt 
cutting-edge technical solutions to keep 
the crowdsale proceeds safe, certain cyber 
thefts could be hardly unpreventable. 
7) Flaws in Source Code 
Nobody can guarantee the source code of 
AICHAIN to be flaw-free. It may contain 
certain flaws, errors, defects and bugs, 
which may disable some functionality 
for users, expose users’ information 
or otherwise. Such flaws, if any, would 
compromise the usability, stability, and/
or security of AICHAIN and consequently 
bring adverse impact on the value of 
AICHAIN Token. Open source codes rely 
on transparency to promote communi -
ty-sourced identification and solution of 
problems within the code. The AICHAIN 
Foundation will work closely together 
with the AICHAIN community to keep 
improving, optimizing and perfecting the 
source code of AICHAIN onards. AICHAIN 
Whitepaper51
AICHAIN8) Unpermissioned, Decentralized and 
Autonomous Ledger 
There are three prevailing categories of 
distributed ledger adopted among the 
contemporary blockchain projects, namely, 
unpermissioned ledger, consortium ledger 
and private ledger. AICHAIN’s underlying 
distributed ledger is an unpermissioned 
one, which means it is publicly accessible 
and useable to everyone on a permis -
sion-free basis. While AICHAIN is initially 
developed by the AICHAIN Foundation, 
it is not owned, operated or otherwise 
controlled by the AICHAIN Foundation. The 
community of AICHAIN, which is sponta -
neously formed and is open, decentralized 
and admission-free to join, is composed of 
users, fans, developers, AICHAIN Token 
holders and other participants worldwide 
who are mostly not connected with the 
AICHAIN Foundation in any manner. 
Such a community will be decentralized 
and autonomous as to the maintenance, 
governance and even evolution of AICHAIN 
while the AICHAIN Foundation will merely 
be an active player in the community peer 
to others without supreme or arbitrary 
authority, irrespective of its earlier 
efforts and contributions to the genesis of 
AICHAIN. As a result, it is not at the mercy 
of the AICHAIN Foundation how AICHAIN 
would be governed or evolve after the 
Launch. 
9) Update of Source Code 
The source code of AICHAIN is open and 
could be updated, amended, altered or 
modified from time to time by any member of the community of AICHAIN. Nobody is 
able to foresee or guarantee the precise 
result of an update, amendment, alteration 
or modification. As a result, any update, 
amendment, alteration or modification 
could lead to an unexpected or unintended 
outcome that adversely affects AICHAIN’s 
operation or AICHAIN Token’s value. 
10) Security Weakness 
The blockchain of AICHAIN rests on 
open-source software and is an unpermis -
sioned distributed ledger. Regardless of 
the AICHAIN Foundation’s effort to keep 
the AICHAIN system secure, anyone may 
intentionally or unintentionally introduce 
weaknesses or bugs into the core infra -
structural elements of AICHAIN which 
the security measures adopted by the 
AICHAIN Foundation are unable to prevent 
or remedy. This may consequently result 
in the loss of AICHAIN Token or any other 
digital tokens held by a purchaser. 
11) “Distributed Denial of Service” 
Attack 
The Ethereum is designed to be public and 
unpermissioned and therefore may suffer 
cyber-attacks of “distributed denial of 
service” from time to time. Such attacks 
will adversely affect, stagnate or paralyze 
the network of the AICHAIN system and 
accordingly render the transactions 
thereon delayed to be recorded or included 
in the blocks of the Ethereum blockchain or 
even temporarily unable to be performed.
12) Insufficiency of Processing Power AICHAIN 
Whitepaper52
AICHAINThe rapid growth of AICHAIN will be 
accompanied by a surge of transaction 
numbers and demand of processing 
power. If the demand of processing power 
outgrows how much the nodes of the 
Ethereum blockchain network can then 
provide, the network of AICHAIN could 
be destabilized and/or stagnated, and 
there could be fraudulent or false transac -
tions such as “double-spending” to arise. 
In the worst-case scenario, the AICHAIN 
Token held by the purchasers could be 
lost, and rollback or even hardforking of 
the blockchain of the Ethereum could be 
triggered. All these aftermaths would do 
harm to the usability, stability and security 
of AICHAIN and the value of AICHAIN 
Token. 
13) Unauthorized Claim of AICHAIN 
Token for Crowdsale 
Any person who gains access to the 
AICHAIN Token purchaser’s registered 
email or registered account by deciphering 
or cracking the purchaser’s password will 
be able to claim the purchased AICHAIN 
Token for Crowdsale in bad faith. As such, 
the relevant purchased AICHAIN Token for 
Crowdsale may be missent to the person 
whoever claims that the same through the 
purchaser’s registered email or registered 
account, which sending is not revocable or 
reversible. Each AICHAIN Token purchaser 
shall take care of the security of his/her 
registered email and registered account 
throughout by taking such actions as: 
(i) using a highly secure password; (ii) 
refraining from opening or responding to 
any scam emails; and (iii) keeping strictly confidential all the secret or personal 
information about himself/herself. 
14) Private Key of AICHAIN Token Wallet 
The loss or destruction of a private key 
required to access AICHAIN Token may be 
irreversible. AICHAIN Token are control -
lable only by possessing both the relevant 
unique public and private keys through 
the local or online AICHAIN Token wallet. 
Each purchaser is required to safeguard 
the private keys contained in his/her own 
AICHAIN Token wallet(s). Where such 
private key of a AICHAIN Token purchaser 
is lost, missing, divulged, destroyed or 
otherwise compromised, neither the 
AICHAIN Foundation nor anyone else will 
be able to help the purchaser access or 
retrieve the related AICHAIN Token. 
15) Popularity 
The value of AICHAIN Token hinges heavily 
on the popularity of the AICHAIN system. 
AICHAIN is not expected to be popular, 
prevalent or widely used soon after the 
Launch. The worst-case scenario is that 
AICHAIN may even remain marginal -
ized in the long run, appealing to only a 
minimal portion of the users. By contrast, 
a significant portion of AICHAIN Token 
demand could be of speculative nature. 
The lack of users may result in increasing 
volatility of AICHAIN Token market price 
and consequently compromise AICHAIN’s 
long-term development. The AICHAIN 
Foundation will not (nor has the respon -
sibility to) stabilize or otherwise affect 
AICHAIN Token’s market price if there is AICHAIN 
Whitepaper53
AICHAINany such price. 
16 ) Liquidity 
AICHAIN Token is not a currency issued 
by any individual, entity, central bank or 
national, supra-national or quasi-national 
organization, nor is it backed by any hard 
assets or other credit. The circulation and 
trading of AICHAIN Token on the market 
are not what the AICHAIN Foundation 
is responsible for or pursues. Trading of 
AICHAIN Token merely depends on the 
consensus on its value between the relevant 
market participants. Nobody is obliged to 
redeem or purchase any AICHAIN Token 
from any AICHAIN Token holder (including 
the purchasers). Nor does anyone guarantee 
the liquidity or market price of AICHAIN 
Token to any extent at any time. To divest 
his/her AICHAIN Token, a AICHAIN Token 
holder would have to locate one or more 
willing buyers to purchase the same at a 
mutually agreed price, which attempt could 
be costly and time-consuming and does 
not necessarily bear fruit. And there could 
be no crypto-currency exchange or other 
marketplace having AICHAIN Token listed 
thereon for trading. 
17) Price Volatility 
Cryptographic tokens, if traded on public 
markets, usually have extremely volatile 
prices. Fluctuations in price over short 
periods of time frequently occur, which 
price may be denominated in Bitcoin, Ether, 
US Dollars or any other fiat currency. Such 
fluctuations could result from market 
forces (including speculations), regulatory changes, technical innovations, availability 
of exchanges and other objective factors 
and represent changes in the balance 
of supply and demand. The AICHAIN 
Foundation is not responsible for any 
secondary market trading of AICHAIN 
Token no matter whether or not there 
would be such markets for AICHAIN Token. 
Therefore, the AICHAIN Foundation neither 
is obliged to tame the price volatility of 
AICHAIN Token nor cares about that. The 
risks associated with AICHAIN Token 
trading price have to be taken by the 
AICHAIN Token traders themselves. 
18) Competition 
AICHAIN’s underlying protocol is based 
on an open-source computer software 
such that nobody claims copyright or any 
other type of intellectual property right 
of the source code. As a result, anyone 
can legally copy, replicate, reproduce, 
engineer, modify, upgrade, improve, 
recode, reprogram or otherwise utilize the 
source code and/or underlying protocol 
of AICHAIN in an attempt to develop a 
competing protocol, software, system 
or virtual platform or virtual machine, 
which is out of the AICHAIN Foundation’s 
control and may consequently compete 
with or even overshadow or overtake 
AICHAIN. Besides, there have been and will 
be various competing blockchain-based 
platforms that compete with AICHAIN. 
The AICHAIN Foundation will in no case 
be capable of eliminating, preventing, 
restricting or minimizing such competing 
efforts that aim to contest with or overtake 
AICHAIN.
