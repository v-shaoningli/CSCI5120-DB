3   1. Growing numbers of crypto-affluents neglected by the luxury   industry    Cryptocurrencies are sky-rocketing in value. The value of bitcoin, the first and most well-known crypto-currency, has increased seven-fold in the last year. Some alt-coins have even seen growth of a few thousand percent over the last 2 years – indeed no other category of asset has offered such upside in the last decade.   This along with the token sale boom and the rich 24-7 trading opportunities fueled by price volatility has created a growing new community of affluent people – the “crypto-affluents”.  The founders of Aditus are veteran entrepreneurs in the luxury space, and we have noticed increasing numbers of such crypto-affluents at our luxury events. However, in our discussions with them, we have received feedback that while many crypto-affluents desire services offered by luxury merchants, they still lack access to it, and feel excluded.   This unfortunate disconnect is driven by the following factors:   • Few luxury merchants accept crypto-currencies   • Crypto-users are more privacy-conscious than your average user, while luxury merchants need more targeting data than your average marketer to market their goods  • Luxury lifestyle merchants simply do not know how to reach crypto-affluents   Luxury merchants are among the most traditional of companies, and are used to traditional modes of marketing.  They simply have no way to easily reach out to crypto-affluents. This is especially so as we have observed that the crypto-currency / blockchain community is as insular as the luxury industry.  Luxury merchants have always required more targeted marketing due to the niche nature of their products and the need for the right brand positioning. That higher level of targeting is currently obtained through channels that extensively track user’s preferences and spending habits.  As an example, the Amex Centurion card and other premium credit cards are how many luxury merchants reach out to fiat-millionaires. The data tracking of fiat millionaires in traditional banking systems allow luxury merchants to target and identify the right audience for their products.  Short of crypto-affluents converting all their crypto-assets into fiat currencies, subjecting themselves to traditional banking systems and its perennial tracking1, what we have is a double-sided access problem, in which luxury merchants similarly cannot reach crypto-affluents.   																																																								1 In our conversations with many crypto-affluents, converting a significant amount of one’s crypto-holdings to fiat is either offensive from an ideological standpoint, or financially totally self-defeating given the growth still to come in crypto-currency values. 	
	
4 2. A trillion dollar opportunity  2.1  Luxury Industry hungry for growth   The luxury lifestyle business is a trillion-dollar, high margin business encompassing many product categories.  A few examples of sub-industries that constitute the luxury lifestyle:  
    Global Luxury Travel Luxury Goods Art Yacht Charters US$ 1,154 billion >US$ 300 billion >US$ 35 billion >US$ 878 million   With slowing growth for almost all luxury lifestyle categories, serving the new crypto-affluents is a golden opportunity for all luxury merchants.  With new money pouring into crypto-investment and new crypto-wealth being created everyday, there is a similar golden opportunity for the first platform that can link luxury merchants with crypto-affluents.  Aditus is building that market-first platform.   2.2  The Even Larger Opportunity : Solving mainstream crypto-adoption   Until crypto-currencies are widely adopted and used in commercial transactions, their market value will mainly be a result of financial market speculation, and will remain volatile.   Yet for such mainstream crypto-adoption to happen, there needs to be much more merchants accepting crypto-currencies, giving .  Aditus’s larger vision is to solve this huge problem of crypto-currency adoption. We are merely starting with the luxury industry – an industry we know extremely well and have competitive advantages in.  Some of the problems that require to be solved are:  1. More comprehensive payment gateway solutions • Merchants have expenses payable in fiat currencies and require crypto to fiat conversion solutions • A combination of technical and market solutions need to be developed that can ameliorate the difficulty, costs and time of converting crypto to fiat  2. Better marketing solutions to reach crypto-users 
	
	
5 • With low acceptance of crypto-currencies among companies in general, if merchants do not reach out to crypto-users to inform them, crypto users simply would not be aware of it.   The Aditus platform solutions will be rolled out first among luxury merchants, and use of it will be applicable among many other industries.   3. Introducing Aditus - The first luxury lifestyle access platform serving crypto-affluents  globally   Aditus means access in Latin.  We will create this first-ever access through a platform that can uniquely bridge the needs of both crypto-users and luxury merchants.   In short, the Aditus Platform consists of two technical layers  1) Rewards and Marketing Layer • users receive customized offers directly from merchants pre-purchase • users directly rewarded for engagement with merchants • eliminates need for a centralized 3rd party marketer – ensuring data privacy  2) Payment and Transactions Layer • Users pay in crypto-currencies • Merchants can receive in crypto-currencies or fiat • Payment can be held until fulfillment of service   
 
	
	
6 Based on Ethereum, the Aditus Platform will operate essentially as an application level protocol for marketing and engagement as well as payment.  Drawing on decades of experience in the luxury industry of its founders and advisors, Aditus creates a wholly new platform that is decentralized, and integrates encryption, smart contracts and payment gateways that:  • Empowers crypto-users to enjoy access to a rich offering of luxury products and services in complete privacy • Enables luxury merchants to target market customers, and to engage with possible customers without 3rd party middlemen, yet still without infringing on user’s privacy • Allows crypto-users to make purchases with the crypto-currency of their choice, and merchants to receive payments in the currency of their choice   The following principles guide the construction of the Aditus platform:  • Users maintain full control of their own data • No user data is tracked by Aditus or any other party without the User’s express authorization – any data that is not decentralized will be fully encrypted • No user data is transferred or shared without the User’s express authorization  Aditus also offers paid membership programs in which users enjoy a whole package of luxury rewards like concierge services and access to the most exclusive products / services / establishments in the world. Think the equivalent of an top tier credit card rewards program exclusively for crypto-users.  
 Diagram: A selection of industries Aditus covers   To ensure the best-in-class technology, Aditus is in partnership with some of the most prominent blockchain companies in the world. Roll-out initiatives are also planned with these companies.  Last but not least, Aditus also organizes frequent physical events, meant to increase interactions between fiat affluents and the crypto-space, between crypto-affluents and lifestyle providers, as well as between fiat affluents and crypto-affluents themselves.  Through the Aditus app, the most exclusive experiences, events, establishments, products and services globally are all accessible to crypto-affluents.

Please see Appendix : “Full User Run Through”   4.1  Aditus Smart Invitations: Smart Contract-powered  Marketing, Rewards And Incentives  Aditus users receive Smart Invitations from luxury merchants that fit their preferences.   Each Smart Invitation is powered by an Ethereum smart contract that rewards users with ADITUS Tokens upon successful validation of a desired user action.    Smart Invitations reward 3 types of desired user actions:  a. Physical Engagement eg: “Please visit our physical showroom and obtain 20 ADITUS Tokens”  • >90% of all luxury purchases happen in a physical store because the “touch and feel” experience as well as the trust factor is more important for users buying luxury.  • As such merchants are willing to invite Aditus users to their stores and reward them for it as part of their marketing efforts.  • This is also true for exhibitors at large scale luxury and art shows. • Through the scanning of a QR code onsite at the physical showroom / store, the smart contract powering the Smart Invitation is validated, and the promised number of ADITUS tokens is transferred to the user.   b. Share data:  eg  “Please share your email address with us so we can send u a brochure, and obtain 10 ADITUS Tokens”   • Data is key for effective luxury marketing and sales follow-up. • On Aditus, users control and own their own data, unlike credit card companies and banks that track and sell customer marketing data  • As such, merchants who wish to collect more data will offer ADITUS Tokens as a reward to users for offering that data.  • It is always the user’s choice whether to share data with the merchants or not. • To prevent abuse of the system, only data pre-verified and stored on the decentralized Aditus app, can be shared by the users to merchants in return for ADITUS tokens. 	
	
10 • This data is encrypted and sent directly to the Smart Invitation, where it can only be unlocked by the merchant originating the Smart Invitation.     c. Purchase at a Special Price: eg “Please purchase my product/service using the Aditus wallet and obtain a 5% cashback”    • For outsiders to luxury, it may seem that luxury merchants rarely offer discounts. • This is because luxury merchants are reluctant to publicise discounts to their products for fear it would damage their brand positioning. • Yet, special prices are often offered in situations when the merchant wishes to close the sale in a face-to-face situation, or when the Merchant is convinced of the quality of the potential customer. • A quirk within the luxury industry is that many luxury merchants prefer to give cash-back instead of discounts because cash-backs o Does not affect top-line revenues, as the cash-back is funded from another expense item in their P/L statement o There is often a third party involved in giving the cash-back (eg credit card), meaning the brand is technically not giving a discount • The Aditus platform uniquely combines targeting features for merchants, and strong privacy controls for users.  • This makes it ideal for merchants to confidently offer special prices to users because they know it will not be visible to non-targeted persons.  • As an example:   • An alcohol merchant creates a Smart Invitation for a cask of whiskey offering a 10% cash-back for orders.  • The Smart Invitation only targets Aditus VIP users who have purchased spirits above a certain amount in the past 6 months. • When an Aditus user decides to act on the offer, he initiates payment from his wallet into the smart contract powering the Smart Invitation • The smart contract automatically applies the cash-back offer.     4.2 Voting Rights to Program Line-Up at Aditus Events  The Aditus co-founders are veteran entrepreneurs with a long track record of organising luxury events attracting large numbers of fiat-affluents, and also increasing numbers of crypto-affluents in the last 2 years.  Aditus organizes events intended to encourage interactions and mingling between both communities of affluent individuals. Our first such event was Virtual Currencies Talk, held on-site at the yacht and luxury show Singapore RendezVous. The Talk had 5 respected speakers from the blockchain world, and attracted over 200 attendees from both fiat and crypto spaces, as well as 4 start-ups pitching their token sales. (See 10.4 Crypto and Fiat Millionaire Outreach: Aditus Foundation)  In order to build an engaged community, Aditus token holders will have the right to vote on the content, such as ICO pitches, of upcoming events. 			4.3 Secure Multi-Cryptocurrency Wallet + Seamless Payment At  Merchants  	
	
11  A core service offering of the Aditus platform is secure multi-crypto currency wallet within the Aditus App, as well as the roll-out of crypto-payment gateways at luxury merchants.   
   Aditus Wallet  Being a multi-currency wallet, the user can choose different crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum to pay for the products / services offered by an Aditus Alliance merchant.   However, Aditus offers cash-back (more accurately ‘token-back’) and other “in-kind” incentives (eg free bottle of champagne in your beach villa reserved through Aditus) for using the ADITUS Token as the payment currency.  Because of the Aditus’ team’s unique strengths in user acquisition among fiat millionaires, it is likely that the Aditus crypto-currency wallet will be the first mobile crypto-currency wallet downloaded and used by many fiat millionaires. (See Pt 10 ‘Roll-Out Plan’)  Payment Gateways  Essential to the Aditus platform is rolling-out payment gateways at our merchants.   In addition to working with partners, we will be developing our own payment gateway called Aditus PayTM which will tie into Aditus Rewards, our marketing and rewards layer.  Integrating APIs from exchanges and liquidity providers, we will enable luxury merchants to be paid in the currency of their choice. In so doing, we will initiate luxury merchants into the crypto-age.     4.4  Maximum Privacy Protection Through Decentralisation  Luxury marketers require more targeting data than the average marketer to run effective campaigns. Specifically, the ideal luxury marketing campaign needs 3 categories of targeting data:  1) Personal / Demographic Data 2) Preferences data 3) Transaction data  Yet there will always be a constant struggle between merchants and consumers with regards to data: merchants and marketers always want as much as possible, users always want to give as little as possible. 
	
	
12  To make matters worse, many crypto-users are even more particular about privacy than your average consumer.  In current models, 3rd party platforms like banks, credit card companies or large marketing platforms as Google and Facebook track collect as much data as possible about their users. The data is then used by these platforms to create marketing solutions, or even to be on-sold to other companies and data brokers. A look at the Terms of Use Agreements of these services would reveal that many of these platforms have ownership rights over user data.   In the case of banks and credit card companies, vast amounts of transaction data are also tracked along with other personal data. Given the need for luxury merchants to identify customers who both have the means and the interest, the banks and credit card companies become a powerful channel to promote their service offerings.  On Aditus, we reconcile both the privacy needs of crypto-users and the targeting needs luxury marketers through a unique decentralized platform and encryption.   
  • While Aditus users do have to input contact and preference data to receive Smart Invitations, this data is encrypted and stored on their mobile devices.  • All user data within the Aditus app is encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). • This data never leaves the phone unless specifically authorized by the user. • Transaction data through the Aditus wallet is on the blockchain and contain no identifying data.  • Matching of merchant’s targeting requirements and user data is done locally on user’s mobile device (decentralized matching), so merchants do not get access to users until users choose to initiate engagement with the merchants..   • Our centralized servers run only the code of our front-facing user interfaces, and store no user data.    Thus, on Aditus, user data is always solely within the control and ownership of the user.  We do anticipate users who may value convenience over privacy, we will offer a freemium service for users to store their data on an encrypted server, so that they may be able to transfer their personal data between phones.  However, Aditus as a platform is set up to satisfy the most rigorous of privacy requirements in the user’s browsing, engagement and transactions with luxury merchants. It is a platform that can serve even the most privacy-demanding of crypto-affluents. 
	
	
13  5. Aditus Value Proposition for Luxury Merchants  Aditus’ core value proposition for luxury merchants is to allow them to reach the growing new community of crypto-affluents. In a period of slowing growth, this is a golden opportunity for luxury merchants to use Aditus’ platform to be the first to serve this new group of wealthy individuals.   Aditus’ built in incentives and rewards platform also allows them to be the first to build loyalty and brand awareness with this new group of customers.  The Aditus team is highly experienced in building marketing platforms linking luxury merchants and affluent individuals, from websites to apps to magazines to events to rewards programs.  Besides opening up the new customer category of crypto-affluents to luxury merchants, Aditus also allows merchants to reward the user directly, without paying the bulk of their marketing budgets to middlemen.   The Brave browser and its Basic Attention Token offers a direct way for online advertisers to reward users for their attention, thereby cutting through multiple middlemen and so aims to solve the highly fragmented digital advertising ecosystem.   Serious problems similarly have always existed in luxury marketing because:  1) The physical touch & feel experience and physical engagement are extremely important in luxury purchases3, which means unlike e-commerce, there can be a considerable time gap between marketing and the actual transaction   2) Luxury marketing requires more precise targeting data to be effective.   3) Luxury merchants do not like to publicise discounts and rewards openly for fear of diminishing their brand positioning   The introduction of Smart Invitations and our decentralized platform allows luxury merchants to reward users for desired actions directly, providing them with a degree of accountability not currently offered by any marketing platform, whether they are on-chain or off-chain.    6. Business Model   Aditus operates at core a transaction and marketing platform between luxury merchants and crypto-affluents. On this platform, the Aditus generates revenues through:   1) Admin fees for Merchants to generate Smart Invitations  2) Marketing Commissions on Transactions 																																																								3 Even after close to 20 years of development in the e-commerce market, and despite all the media attention surrounding the e-commerce in luxury, >90% of all luxury purchases are still made in physical points of sale.  	
	
14 We pre-negotiate transaction commissions from participating merchants, so that Aditus makes a commission on every sale. This is to be distinguished from the Payment Gateway Fees below.  3) Payment Gateway fees When merchants require the use of our payment gateways, they pay a small fee. We anticipate this fee would be lower than those charged by credit card data networks. This fee is shared with partners involved in the payment gateway.  4) Membership fees from VIP users when they subscribe for the Aditus VIP Membership   7.

These platforms will be utilized to the maximum in promoting Aditus.  7.4 Past Clients in Luxury 	Through our combined >30 years of experience in luxury, we have developed a good track-record as well as long relationships with every major luxury brand, and hundreds of lesser-known ones across every product category.   Of note also is that we have been at the forefront of rolling out latest technological solutions to clients, being the first to sign brands for online advertising, and luxury brand stores for mobile marketing and mobile rewards programs. Communicating, educating and rolling-out new technological solutions among luxury brands are a forte of our team.  Besides the luxury brands, we have also strong working relationships with the companies that form the ‘inner infrastructure’ of the luxury industry eg, concierge companies, rewards companies, membership clubs etc.  We will use these connections and knowledge to recruit merchants onto our platform. 
	
	
18   Diagram: A small selection of the founder’s past luxury clients   8. The Aditus Token  8.1 Role of Token   The ADITUS Token is an ERC20 standard token. It serves the following functions:  1) Membership Proof for Users : to access Smart Invitations and our VIP membership program 2) Membership Proof for Merchants: to create Smart Invitations and use the Merchant’s Console 3) Rewards and Incentive Currency within Aditus platform 4) A possible transaction currency within Aditus ecosystem 5) Voting Rights on program line-up of Aditus Events  A thriving value eco-system requires strong and sustained token values. We anticipate token demand from the following categories of token holders:  Demand from Crypto Affluents • They will need ADITUS Tokens to access luxury lifestyle services on the Aditus platform 
	
	
19 • Number of crypto-affluents will continue to grow.  Demand from Fiat Affluents • They will acquire ADITUS Tokens as part of our roll-out efforts (see Pt 10 User Acquisition below) • Because of our unique roll-out plans, and the difficulty that fiat-affluents still face in getting even their first bitcoin, ADITUS might be the first crypto-currency for many fiat-affluents, and the Aditus app their first crypto-wallet. • Aditus will be their gateway to the world of blockchain and crypto-currencies.  Demand from Luxury Merchants • They will acquire ADITUS Tokens to create Smart Invitations to reach Aditus’ users • In a time of slowing growth, the ADITUS tokens represent how luxury merchants will access this extremely attractive new customer community of crypto-affluents  	8.2 Voting on Program Line-Up of Aditus Events   Our long term goals of building a vibrant community of users, merchants, and token holders motivated and incentivized to help Aditus improve its offerings, and to grow and succeed.   A key aspect is an engaged community that offers regular feedback, and Aditus will run User Feedback Surveys every month.  In addition, Aditus token holders will have the right to vote on the content (eg participating ICO pitches) on upcoming events, or merchants to be next included on our platform.  We will offer voting on the program line-ups at our events and also on strategic decisions made with the platform roll-out.  	9. Initial Token Sale  9.1 Overview  Our Initial Token Sale was completed on 20 December 2017.   For full details of our token distribution, please refer to our official announcement on the matter here.   https://medium.com/aditusnetwork/aditus-adi-token-allocation-the-details-2016e937e833    9.2 Use of Token Sale Funds  The funds from our Token Sales is to execute our Roll-Out Road Map (see Pt 10), and can be categorized into the headings below:  	
	
20     10. Roll-Out Road Map   10.1 User Acquisition / Roll Out    Many white papers are light on describing roll-out plans, but we at Aditus firmly believe that while the technical components are crucial, user acquisition and the ability to build a vibrant ecosystem are equally important in determining whether a token (and its company) gains value (and influence) over time.   As such we have detailed our roll-out plans for Aditus below:   They fall into 4 main heads:  (1) Intensive Marketing to Crypto Communities through Global PR and Marketing (2) Physical Roll Out at Luxury Events (3) Crypto and Fiat-Affluents Outreach through the Aditus Foundation (4) Strategic Partners  Each will be explained in detail below. 	 10.2 Intensive Marketing to Crypto and Fiat Affluent  Communities  We will run a global marketing and communication campaign to reach crypto-affluents and fiat-millionaires highly interested in crypto-currencies.  We will execute frequent communication on our operational milestones reached. Press releases and content marketing articles will be pushed on blockchain related websites (by our count >400), as well as general lifestyle sites will also be targeted.   We also wish to work with partners to reach out to online communities on closed social networks like Telegram, membership forums etc.  
	
	
21 One of our key competitive strengths here is that Aditus founders not only own luxury media platforms reaching almost a million readers monthly, but we are also known to be expert marketers.   10.3  Physical Roll Out at Luxury Shows  Luxury shows (yacht shows, art shows, auctions etc) are ideal channels to roll-out Aditus. They attract millions of affluent visitors every year, and represent an extremely unique concentration of High Net Worth Individuals all in one location (captive audience from a marketing perspective).   Billions of dollars are transacted at these shows, as the exhibitors of these shows usually represent the crème-de la crème of luxury merchants.   The fact that our co-founder Olivier Burlot is an experienced founder of major luxury shows, and is well-connected within the luxury space, is also a huge competitive advantage. Olivier was one of the co-founders of Hainan RendezVous, a large-scale yacht and luxury show in China. He also presently co-owns, through Heart Media: Singapore RendezVous, Phuket RendezVous and Penang RendezVous.  
   How will we roll out Aditus at luxury shows?  Aditus will be used by exhibitors (who are all luxury merchants) as the engagement and lead generation platform for their booths.   Show attendees (fiat and crypto-affluents) will use the Aditus app to obtain Invitations and information targeted to their preferences, serving as a powerful complement to the typical show catalogue.  For certain shows, The Aditus platform and tokens can also be used for making in-show payments such as for drinks or even actual purchases of goods. The diagram below shows the use of Aditus at a partner show.   
	
	
22   As seen from the diagram above, the show environment really is a micro-universe of how Aditus will be used generally.  By rolling out Aditus at luxury shows, we have the advantage of  (1) Exposing merchants to the benefits of Aditus directly, speeding up merchant acquisition for our membership programs (2) Allowing users to physically experience the Aditus ecosystem in action (3) Have the captive attention (and in many cases physical booth space) to answer questions directly from users  Indeed, the physical touch and feel factor is extremely important in luxury4. Aditus, being a luxury product itself, will build trust and branding from this approach from the beginning.  Also notable is our activities for the Aditus Foundation, which will also be running parallel events for the shows (see 10.4).  Post ITS, we have an entire schedule of shows to roll-out Aditus in 2018:  Month Name Nature Location Jan 2018 Art Stage Singapore Art Show Singapore Jan 2018 Phuket RendezVous Integrated luxury show at a yachting marina Phuket, Thailand Mar 2018 Art Basel Art Show Hong Kong Apr 2018 Penang RendezVous Integrated luxury show at a yachting marina Penang, Malaysia Aug 2018 Salon Prive Classic Car and Luxury Show Bleinheim Palace, UK Sep 2018 Chantily Arts et Elegance Art Show Paris, France Sep 2018 Cannes Yachting Festival Yacht Show Cannes, France Oct 2018 Singapore RendezVous Integrated luxury show at a yachting marina Singapore Nov 2018 Bund Classic Classic Car and Luxury Show Shanghai, China 																																																								4 >90% of all luxury purchases still occur in physical stores, despite the presence and growth of luxury e-commerce platforms over a decade. 
	
	
23   10.4 Crypto and Fiat Millionaire Outreach: Aditus Foundation  Crypto and Fiat Affluent Communities will eventually merge  The Aditus Foundation is part of our long term plan to not only acquire users for Aditus but to play our part in encouraging awareness and adoption of both crypto-currencies and blockchain technologies.   We envision that the crypto-community will not remain insular for long. ‘New blood’ in the form of fiat millionaires entering the crypto-space is only a matter of time, although there are currently many barriers to entry and understanding.  The Aditus Foundation has the twin goals of (1) Evangelisation and education of crypto-currency and blockchain use among HNWI and corporates (2) Encouraging interactions between crypto-affluents and fiat affluents   Activities of the Aditus Foundation  The Aditus Foundation will run frequent events, educational seminars and gatherings for both crypto-enthusiasts and fiat millionaires.   We will also run curated Initial Token Sale selections in which token companies will get a chance to present to affluent individuals.   Besides the gatherings, we will also run larger ‘crypto-retreats’ in conjunction with the major luxury shows rolling out Aditus.  Indeed, we will set up different Chapters of the Aditus Foundation in different countries, each led by a key influencer in that country.   
  The first Virtual Currencies Talk organized by the Aditus Foundation on 7 October 2017. The talk was held at the location of the Singapore RendezVous 2017. It attracted over 200 participants, an equal mix of crypto-affluents and fiat-affluents. 4 ICO pitches were made along with many distinguished speakers from the blockchain and crypto-currency space.  Blockshow was one of our partners.       How the Foundation helps User Acquisition for the Aditus Platform  
	
	
24 Through the activities of the Foundation, we hope to reach and ‘convert’ many more fiat millionaires into crypto-users. And we believe for many of these new users, the Aditus wallet will be their first crypto-currency wallet, and ADITUS will be their first token.   10.5 Strategic Partners   As the first luxury lifestyle rewards platform in the crypto-currency space, Aditus will have first mover advantage in signing synergistic partnerships with partners.  For eg: crypto-currency debit cards like TenX, Monaco etc are ideal partners for us as they would all need a rewards program to complement their card. Partnering with Aditus allows them to focus on their mission-critical goal of guaranteeing payment network stability while leaving the rewards components to us.  We have already in discussions with many prominent companies in the space, and many are interested in having co-branding partnerships in which Aditus designs special rewards programs for their users. Some examples of companies we have secured partnerships with include Kyber networks, Digix Global, and Pundi X.  When the Aditus user base hits a certain size, “old-world” companies like banks and luxury conglomerates will find us impossible to ignore. We will be able to sign partnerships with them either to acquire tokens for their operational use, or to cross-market Aditus to their customers.  Our co-founder Julian Peh will lead this head of marketing. Julian is an experienced digital platform builder with extensive experience in partnerships, having previously clinched partnerships with banks, credit card companies and hundreds of luxury brands through his Chinese traveller-focused global rewards platform SERA奢励.   	10.6 Planned Roll Out Time Line 	 Time Activity Notes Dec 2017     Initial Token Sale   Jan to Mar 2018 • Beta version of Aditus ready for launch  • Roll-out and/or Publicity at Phuket RendezVous • Intensive online marketing for Aditus • Aditus listed on first exchanges    Mar to Jun 2018       • Getting Aditus exchangeable with other cryptocurrencies  • Intensive online PR outreach in crypto-community to jumpstart secondary market transactions for Aditus  • User Merchant Acquisition through the following shows: • Mar 18: Art Basel Hong Kong • Apr 18: I-Property, Kuala Lumpur (TBC) • May18: Penang Rendez-Vous  • Intensive PR and marketing will be done after each milestone reached to maintain buzz and interest in token.  • We will work on getting more merchants to accept Build liquidity and secondary market for tokens, expand ecosystem, build buzz, grow community 	
	
25   11. Conclusion   The luxury lifestyle industry is a trillion-dollar business hungry for growth, and new crypto-affluents and crypto-millionaires are being minted every day. Even while the crypto-markets remains in its infant stages, there is a unique opportunity to seize the first mover advantage and be the first to serve a huge neglected community of affluent people through their lifestyle needs.  That combined with the our unique competitive advantages and our focused user acquisition plans, means we are well placed to build a luxury lifestyle platform powered by crypto-currencies, enjoyed by a thriving and motivated community made up of discerning individuals originating from both fiat and crypto-currencies in the new crypto-currency economy.  The successful execution of our roll-out plan will cement Aditus’, and the ADITUS Token’s, position at the core of the luxury lifestyle within the new age of crypto-currencies, an influential and profitable position for a platform to be.    Aditus as a payment currency through payment gateways.     Q3, Q4 2018 • With a sufficient user-base we will start asking our partners / merchants to start launching specialised projects accepting ADITUS Tokens solely.   • Even now, we have existing interest in the following type of projects: • One-off special editions from luxury brands • Art Auctions • Artist Patronage • Charity Fund-Raising  • This will truly elevate Aditus as a unique token with its own inherent value that people wish to hold. • This will sustain the value of the token and help reduce volatility.   Encourage merchants / partners to create unique offerings for Token holders, to sustain base value of token 
  • Within 18-24 months, Aditus would have established itself as the token held by most number of affluent individuals   • Giant luxury groups like LVMH cannot ignore us - large scale projects like retail integration will be in the works - all involving bulk purchases of Aditus for their operational use  • Banks with an affluent user base cannot ignore us - large scale projects will be proposed - all involving bulk purchases of of Aditus for their operational use Get large organisations to start regularly buying Aditus for their daily operations, to reduce volatility

27 2 Browsing Invitations  
  8) As a newly minted Ordinary Member, the user can now see his Invitations page, auto-populated with all Invitations matching the user’s preferences.  9) These Invitations displayed had been previously set up by merchants via their Aditus Merchant Console. The Merchants input targeting criteria for each Invitation, and must include an offer of ADITUS tokens. and only Invitations with targeting criteria matching User’s Preferences will be displayed.   10) Invitations may come with an offer of ADITUS Tokens in return for the User fulfilling an action.   11) There are 3 possible actions:  a. Engage with Merchant eg: “Pls visit my store and obtain 20 ADITUS Tokens”– validated through the scanning of a QR code onsite at the store  b. Provide data: eg  “Pls provide us with your mailing address for us to send u a brochure, and obtain 10 ADITUS Tokens – handled via the Aditus app’s data management features – the user consents to the sending of the requested data to the user via the Smart Contract  c. Purchase: eg “Pls purchase my product/service using the Aditus wallet and obtain a 5% cashback”  - handled via the Aditus crypto-currency wallet   12) Merchants do not know in advance who will receive the Invitations, thus protecting the privacy of Aditus users before they choose to engage with the merchants.  13) Aditus itself cannot track the preferences of any particular user.  14) The Invitations from the Merchants appearing in the app really are the first level of access to the world of luxury, and are meant for users to browse and save in complete privacy.      
	
	
28 3 Making Transactions via the Aditus wallet  
  15) The second main feature of the Aditus app is the Aditus multi-crypto-currency wallet.   16) Being a multi-currency wallet, the user can use other supported crypto-currencies to pay for the services provided by an Aditus alliance merchant, but Aditus provides cash-back (more accurately ‘token-back’) incentives for using the ADITUS token as the payment currency.  17) When the user pays for the desired service using the Aditus wallet and the ADITUS Token, they get an immediate cash-back     18) Making transactions via the Aditus wallet also has the benefit of qualifying you for the exclusive VIP Membership, put together by the Aditus team personally  19) Because of the Aditus’ team’s unique strengths in user acquisition among fiat millionaires, the Aditus crypto-currency wallet will likely be the first mobile crypto-currency wallet to be used by many fiat millionaires    4 Becoming an Aditus VIP Member
